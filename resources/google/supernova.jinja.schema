  title: A template for creating a 10X Genomics Supernova cluster.
  author: Eddie Belter
  description: |
    Create a 10X Genomics Supernova cluster on GCP.

imports:
- path: ../startup-scripts/supernova.py
- path: ../config/tenx.yaml

required:
- disk_size_gb
- machine_type
- region
- remote_data_url
- service_account
- supernova_software_url
- zone

properties:
  disk_size_gb:
    type        : integer
    default     : 2000
    minimum     : 10
    maximum     : 64000
    description : Size of disk for compute nodes.

  machine_type:
    type        : string
    description : |
      Machine type to use for compute node instances, eg. n1-highmem-64.

  project_name:
    type        : string
    default     : adhoc
    description : Project name to use in label on instances.

  notification:
    type        : string
    description : Slack URL to post to a channel when pipelines have completed.

  region:
    type        : string
    description : Region to run the instances in.

  remote_data_url:
    type        : string
    description : Remote data URL (gs://) where pull read fastqs and software, and to push finished assemblies. There should be a software subdir with supernova TGZ. There also needs to be individual sample directory with a reads and assembly sub-buckets.

  service_account:
    type        : string
    default     : default
    description : Service account for compute instances to use.

  ssh_source_ranges:
    type        : array
    description : Restrict supernova compute instance access to a whitelist of IP addresses via a firewall. No firewall is created if no IPs given.

  supernova_software_url:
    type        : string
    description : Supernova software TGZ URL (gs://) to download and untar. This should be obtained from 10X Genomics, and saved in a project bucket.

  zone:
    type        : string
    description : Zone to run the instances in based on region.
